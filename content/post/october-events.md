We had a very succesful Club Rush this week and kickoff planning meeting. We
are now looking forward to our upcoming events in October.

First we will be having a second planning meeting that all are invited to on
October 2nd at 7:30pm in room 510 in the UVU Library.

Our second event will be a movie night with the recently released *Captain
America: The Winter Soldier*. This will be in the Liberal Arts building room
023, on October 9th at 7:00pm.

Everone is invited! The principles of liberty in this film are powerful. Bring
all of your friends.
