# Vouchsafe Verity to the Vox Populi

In other words, "give truth to the voice of the people." To truly cast your own
voice in vote for a candidate, get to know the truth of their position, plans,
and most importantly their principles.

To facilitate such ventures of verification, YAL at UVU is hosting a Meet the
Candidates event at Utah Valley University on October 23rd, from 5pmâ€“7pm.
Several candidates from major and third parties will be attending who are
running for state legislature this November.
