We will be having our first **orientation meeting** tomorrow on Thursday,
September 18th 2014 in the Utah Valley University library on the 5th floor.

The agenda for the meeting is a simple presentation of our basic ideals, and
there will be cookies and brownies and getting to know each other.

The event will be at 7:30pm, and will continue for at least an hour so feel
welcome to drop by at any time.
