Many of you expressed interest in helping us protest the NSA Data Center in
Bluffdale. Well here is your chance! 

This Saturday, Nov 1st from 12-2, Restore the 4th will be hosting a protest! 

We will most likely meet at 11 at the school to make signs, and then carpooling
to Bluffdale! 

Many people have told us that protesting will change nothing and is pointless.
We disagree. We aren't protesting the center in the hopes to shut it down
(though that would be GREAT!) We are protesting in order to keep this topic on
the minds of all Utahn's. We want to send a message that Americans should not
be spied on by their own government!

There are several projects that are aiming to shut down the center, and restore
a bit of our privacy. Offnow.org is a great website to get information about
one way Utahn's are working to close the NSA Data center-- by turning of it's
water. Did you know that the Data Center's computers use millions of gallons of
water everyday? 

If you aren't sure what the NSA is or why we oppose the data center here are
some good links:

* [EFF - NSA Syping](https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying)
* [Pro Publica - NSA Data Collection](http://www.propublica.org/article/nsa-data-collection-faq)

The last one is just F.A.Q's about the NSA and their data collection
techniques. 

Here is the link to the Restore the 4th's [Facebook
event](https://www.facebook.com/events/972310942782584/). If you'd like to join
us RSVP by texting me at: 801-822-8162 so we can have enough vehicles! 

We need to stand up for our rights because no one else will!! 

Keep on fighting!
