We've succesfully completed the first few steps towards re-chartering and have
secured our spot in Utah Valley University's upcoming Club Rush.

Club Rush is an event near the start of each semester that serves as a
recruiting venue for the many clubs at UVU. It takes place in the central
courtyard, which is adjacent to the Student Center among other buildings.

Club Rush this semester is from September 17th to 18th, from 10am to 2pm. We
will be there with a table and display with materials. Come and see us! We'll
welcome anyone interested in advancing liberty to our numbers and we'll be
happy to meet you.
